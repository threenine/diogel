/**
 * Panel-side view of the background request queue.
 *
 * The panel observes and submits decisions; the background owns lifecycle (ADR D1). Nothing here
 * caches authoritative state: every decision is followed by a refresh from the background, so a
 * request that expired or was interrupted meanwhile cannot linger on screen as actionable.
 *
 * State is module-scoped so every consumer in the panel observes one queue. The header shows the
 * pending count while the page shows the request itself; per-caller state would mean two readers
 * racing each other and a count that could disagree with what is on screen.
 *
 * Nothing polls. The background pushes a bare "the queue moved" notification over the panel port
 * and this re-reads (#140). A push carries no state, so it cannot be stale or arrive behind a
 * decision the background has already applied; the answer always comes from a fresh read.

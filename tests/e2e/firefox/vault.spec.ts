/**
 * Vault lifecycle in Firefox (#141).
 *
 * The Chromium suite creates, locks and unlocks a vault; the Firefox project asserted panel parity
 * only, which left the surface a user actually meets first — the vault — covered in one browser.
 *
 * NFR-17 asks for equivalent core behaviour across both, and the panel's vault states are core: a
 * locked panel must render its own unlock view rather than routing to the full-tab login page,
 * which is the regression #147 and #181 both produced in Chromium.

/**
 * The panel returns to its idle view once nothing is waiting (#195).
 *
 * The defect this guards was not a missing navigation. The panel is one route rendering from
 * state, and its template already falls through to the idle view the moment `current` is null —
 * but `current` was never cleared, because the read that would have cleared it never came back.
 *
 * `nostr.requests.current` answers `null` when the queue is empty, and the raw message listener
 * withheld every `null` reply. The panel was left awaiting a promise that never settled and went
 * on showing a request the user had already approved.
 *
 * This lives end to end because the defect is in the seam between the panel and the worker, which
 * is exactly what a unit test mocks away — the same seam as #177 and #186.

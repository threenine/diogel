/**
 * The cross-context signal behind the panel's profile refresh (#201).
 *
 * The dashboard editor and the panel are separate page contexts. Nothing in one hears about a save
 * in the other, so `ProfileView` listens for a storage write instead of a message: the panel port
 * cannot serve this, being one connection per panel that the background counts for presence (#113),
 * and this component also renders on the extension index page.
 *
 * What is asserted here is the platform assumption the whole approach rests on — that
 * `chrome.storage.onChanged` fires in a *different* extension page from the one that wrote. That it
 * is written after a successful publish, and not after a failed one, is covered by unit tests
 * against `profileService`; publishing needs relays, which this harness has none of.

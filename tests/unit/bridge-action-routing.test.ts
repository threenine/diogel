/**
 * Every declared bridge action must be reachable, by one path or the other.
 *
 * There are two: `dispatcher.ts`'s switch, used by the raw `chrome.runtime.onMessage` listener, and
 * `bridge.on` registrations in `background.ts`, used by the Quasar bridge. An action declared in the
 * union but wired to neither is a call that silently does nothing — no error, no route, no reply
 * (#173).
 *
 * This reads the source rather than the runtime because `background.ts` cannot be imported: it
 * registers listeners and calls `initialize()` at load, which is the same reason coverage skips it.

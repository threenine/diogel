 * Guards the one rule both browsers enforce and neither reports usefully.

 * handler. Called anywhere else they reject at runtime, in the background, where nobody is watching
 * — so the failure is a panel that silently does not open (ADR D4, #113).
 *
 * The rule is therefore structural: only the panel-surface port may call them, and only through
 * `openFromUserGesture`, which the toolbar handler invokes.

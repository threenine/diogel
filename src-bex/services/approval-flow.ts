/**
 * The approval decision for a site-initiated request.
 *
 * Extracted from `background.ts` unchanged (#173). It was the security logic in a file nothing could
 * import — the module registers listeners and calls `initialize()` at load — so none of it was
 * reachable from a test, and the coverage report skipped the file entirely rather than reporting it
 * as uncovered.
 *
 * What it decides, in order:
 *
 * 1. which account acts for the origin, because that is the account a grant belongs to (#116)
 * 2. whether an existing grant already answers, short-circuiting without asking the user
 * 3. otherwise, enqueue for the panel and wait for a terminal outcome
 * 4. on approval with a remembered duration, write the grant against the acting account
 * 5. log the outcome on the terminal transition, so a rejection is never recorded as an approval

/**
 * Panel presence.
 *
 * Chromium offers no way to ask whether the side panel is open, and Firefox's
 * `sidebarAction.isOpen` answers only for Firefox. Rather than branch on the browser, presence is
 * taken from a long-lived port the panel opens on mount and the browser tears down when the panel
 * closes. One mechanism, both browsers (ADR D17).
 *
 * Presence is a presentation fact, never a lifecycle one. When the last panel goes away the
 * presented request returns to the queue; nothing is decided, rejected or duplicated, because
 * closing the panel is not a decision (FR-6, S11).
 *
 * The same connection carries queue notifications outward (#140). They say only "the queue moved",
 * never what it moved to: the background stays the single source of truth, and a panel that acts on
 * a notification does so by re-reading rather than by trusting a payload it was handed.

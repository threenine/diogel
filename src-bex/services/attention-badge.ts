/**
 * Toolbar attention policy (ADR D4).
 *
 * Porwr never opens the panel by itself — both browsers require a user gesture — so the toolbar is
 * the only way to say that something is waiting while the panel is closed. `action.setBadgeText`
 * and `action.setTitle` need no permission, which keeps NFR-18 intact.
 *
 * The badge is not announced to assistive technology. While the panel is open, NFR-4 is carried by
 * the in-panel live region; while it is closed, the title is the accessible carrier, which is why
 * it names the count in words rather than relying on the badge alone.

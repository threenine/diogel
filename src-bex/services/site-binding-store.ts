/**
 * Which account each origin signs as.

 * Porwr signs as the account a site is bound to, never as whichever account happens to be active
 * (#116). A NIP-07 client caches the public key it received at login and assumes every later
 * signature comes from that identity; before this, switching the active account silently made that
 * untrue.
 *
 * The binding is established on a site's first use and does not move afterwards. Establishing it
 * takes the active account, because something has to — the security property is that it cannot
 * change underneath a session that has already started.
 *
 * Bindings are keyed by public key, never by alias. Aliases are user-editable, and renaming one
 * must not orphan a binding or hand a site to a different identity.

/**
 * Which account acts for a site.
 *
 * A site is bound to an account, and everything done on that site's behalf — signing, encrypting,
 * decrypting, zapping — uses the bound account rather than whichever account happens to be active
 * (#116). A NIP-07 client caches the public key it received at login and attributes everything
 * afterwards to that identity, so following the active account would silently break that.
 *
 * Encryption matters here as much as signing. Encrypting under the wrong identity tells the
 * recipient the wrong thing about who is talking to them, and decryption under the wrong key simply
 * fails, which looks like data loss rather than an identity mix-up.

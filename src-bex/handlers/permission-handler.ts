/**
 * Permission management for Nostr signing and non-signing requests.
 *
 * A grant is keyed by origin, account, request type, and event kind.
 *
 * The request type is part of the key because it used to be absent: every grant was
 * `(origin, eventKind)`, and `-1` meant "no event kind" at the approval call sites but "any event
 * kind" in the checker, so approving a `get_public_key` request with "always" wrote a record that
 * authorised signing any event kind (#136).
 *
 * The account is part of the key because a grant belongs to the identity the user was looking at
 * when they gave it. Without it, connecting a second account to a site inherited the first
 * account's permissions (#116).
 *
 * Origins are normalised on the way in and on the way out. The binding store already did this and
 * the grant store did not, so the two keyed the same site differently — and `disconnectSite`
 * normalises before filtering grants, which meant a grant stored under an unnormalised origin would
 * have survived the user disconnecting that site.
